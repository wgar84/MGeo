	abstract = {Ecological character displacement occurs when sympatric species compete with one another, resulting in morphological divergence. Theoretically, character displacement can evolve from a number of ecological interactions, such as exploitation, interference, or predation, but most examples describe species competing exploitatively for limiting resources (typically food). Here I report a case of character displacement evolving from aggressive behavioral interference, found in a well-studied system of terrestrial salamanders of the genus Plethodon. Using geometric morphometrics, I found parallel shifts in head shape from allopatry to sympatry in both P. jordani and P. teyahalee, and found significantly greater morphological divergence in sympatry relative to allopatry. Both findings are consistent with ecological character displacement. I also show a significant association between morphology and aggressive behavior, demonstrating a direct link between interference competition and morphology. I present a modified set of the criteria for character displacement that are appropriate for discriminating character displacement via aggressive interference from other possible evolutionary mechanisms. For this example, empirical support satisfying five of the six criteria for character displacement is found. These results provide evidence that morphological variation can be generated by mechanisms other than resource exploitation, which has profound implications for interpreting patterns of biological diversity.},

Competition can also generate morphological shifts, and if competing species co-occur in multiple geographic regions, then repeated instances of competitively-driven morphological divergence (character displacement) can occur.

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}.  Sexual size dimorphism occurs throughout the animal kingdom, and its ecological and evolutionary causes and implications have been intensively studied. Sex-specific differences in bill curvature are known in several species of birds, including some tropical hummingbirds. Despite the importance of bill shape for foraging, comparative studies of sexual dimorphism of bill shape are few. We quantified bill shape in two temperate hummingbird species, Black-chinned Hummingbird (Archilocus alexandri) and Ruby-throated Hummingbird (A. colubris) and compared patterns of sexual shape dimorphism. Several commonly used bill-curvature indices yielded contrasting results; one found differences between species and sexes, a second identified no differences in curvature, and a circle-curvature approach revealed shape differences between species and between the sexes. By contrast, landmark-based geometric morphometric methods identified significant differences in sexual shape dimorphism and also revealed that Ruby-throated Hummingbirds exhibited significant sexual differences in shape, whereas Black-chinned Hummingbirds did not. Female Ruby-throated Hummingbirds exhibited relatively greater bill curvature than males, a pattern consistent with observations of some tropical hummingbirds. Although the causes of differences in bill-shape dimorphism between Black-chinned and Ruby-throated hummingbirds remain unclear, we hypothesize that it may be attributable to differences in the structure of the community in which each species breeds and the interplay between inter- and intraspecific competition for resources in these communities. Finally, we recommend that future studies of bill shape include geometric morphometric approaches because they are better suited than univariate approaches for identifying more complex shape differences within and among species. ,   {RESUMEN}.   El dimorfismo sexual en el tamaño se presenta a través del reino animal, y sus causas e implicancias ecológicas y evolutivas han sido intensamente estudiadas. Las diferencias específicas de los sexos en la curvatura del pico son conocidas en varias especies des aves, incluyendo algunos picaflores tropicales. A pesar de la importancia de la forma del pico para forrajear, los estudios comparativos de dimorfismo sexual en la forma del pico son escasos. Cuantificamos la forma del pico en dos especies de picaflores de la zona templada, Archilocus alexandri y A. colubris, y comparamos los patrones de dimorfismo sexual en la forma. Varios indices de curvatura del pico comúnmente usados arrojaron resultados contrastantes: uno encontró diferencias entre especies y sexos, otro no identificó diferencias en la curvatura y un enfoque de círculo-curvatura reveló diferencias en la forma entre especies y entre los sexos. En contraste, los métodos de morfometría geométrica basados en puntos de referencia identificaron diferencias significativas en el dimorfismo sexual en la forma y también revelaron que A. colubris exhibió diferencias sexuales significativas en la forma, mientras que A. alexandri no. Las hembras de A. colubris exhibieron curvaturas de los picos relativamente mayores que los machos, un patrón que concuerda con observaciones de algunos picaflores tropicales. Aunque las causas de las diferencias en el dimorfismo en la forma del pico entre A. alexandri y A. colubris permanecen poco claras, hipotetizamos que podrían ser atribuibles a diferencias en la estructura de la comunidad en la cual cada especic cria y a la interacción entre competencia inter- e intra-específica por los recursos en estas comunidades. Finalmente, recomendamos que los estudios futuros de la forma del pico incluyan enfoques de morfometria geométrica debido a que son más adecuados que los enfoques univariados para identificar diferencias más complejas en la forma dentro de especies y entre especies.},

	abstract = {We analyzed mandible shape variation of 17 genera belonging to three superfamilies (Cavioidea, Chinchilloidea, and Octodontoidea) of South American caviomorph rodents using geometric morphometrics. The relative influence of phylogeny and ecology on this variation was assessed using phylogenetic comparative methods. Most morphological variation was concentrated in condylar, coronoid, and angular processes, as well as the diastema. Features potentially advantageous for digging (i.e. high coronoid and condylar processes, relatively short angular process, and diastema) were present only in octodontoids; cavioids showed opposing trends, which could represent a structural constraint for fossorial habits. Chinchilloids showed intermediate features. Genera were distributed in the morphospace according to their classification into superfamilial clades. The phylogenetic signal for shape components was significant along phylogeny, whereas the relationship between mandibular shape and ecology was nonsignificant when phylogenetic structure was taken into account. An early evolutionary divergence in the mandible shape among major caviomorph clades would explain the observed strong phylogenetic influence on the variation of this structure. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 102, 828–837.},

	abstract = {Morphological convergence is a central concept in evolutionary biology, but convergent patterns remain under-studied in nonvertebrate organisms. Some scallop species exhibit long-distance swimming, a behaviour whose biomechanical requirements probably generate similar selective regimes. We tested the hypothesis that shell shape similarity in long-distance swimming species is a result of convergent evolution. Using landmark-based geometric morphometrics, we quantified shell shape in seven species representing major behavioural habits. All species displayed distinct shell shapes, with the exception of the two long-distance swimmers, whose shells were indistinguishable. These species also displayed reduced morphological variance relative to other taxa. Finally, a phylogenetic simulation revealed that these species were more similar in their shell shape than was expected under Brownian motion, the model of character evolution that best described changes in shell shape. Together, these findings reveal that convergent evolution of shell shape occurs in scallops, and suggest that selection for shell shape and behaviour may be important in the diversification of the group. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 163, 571–584.},
